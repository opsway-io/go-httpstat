# go-httpstat

`go-httpstat` is a golang package to trace golang HTTP request latency (DNSLookup, TCP Connection and so on). Because it uses [`httptrace`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptrace/) internally, just creating `go-httpstat` powered `context` and giving it your `http.Request` kicks tracing (no big code modification is required). The original idea came from [`httpstat`](https://github.com/reorx/httpstat) command ( and Dave Cheney's [golang implementation](https://github.com/davecheney/httpstat)) üëè. This package now traces same latency infomation as them.
